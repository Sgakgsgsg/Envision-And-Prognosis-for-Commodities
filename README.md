Major Final Year Project 
üìà Stock Market Prediction Models: Linear Regression vs LSTM
üõ† Project Overview
Welcome to my project on stock market prediction! In this repository, I developed and compared two predictive models for forecasting stock prices: Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal was to determine which model offers better predictive accuracy for stock price movements.

üöÄ Features
Two Predictive Models: Developed using Python and popular libraries.

Linear Regression: A traditional statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
LSTM: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series prediction due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.
Performance Comparison: Conducted a thorough comparison of model efficiency using performance metrics and visualization techniques.

üìä Methodology
Data Collection: Gathered historical stock price data from [Data Source].
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the data to make it suitable for model training.
Model Development:
Linear Regression: Implemented a regression model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
LSTM Network: Built an LSTM model to capture temporal dependencies in the stock prices.
Training and Testing: Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Performance Evaluation: Compared the models using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
üîç Results
Performance Metrics: The LSTM model showed superior performance with lower MAE and RMSE compared to the Linear Regression model.
Visualization: Included plots to visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices for both models.
üìà Conclusion
Based on the evaluation metrics, the LSTM model outperformed the Linear Regression model in predicting stock prices. This project highlights the efficacy of using advanced neural networks for time series forecasting over traditional methods.
